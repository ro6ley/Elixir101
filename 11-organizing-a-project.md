# Organizing a Project

Mix is a command line utility that manages Elixir projects. It is used to create new projects, manage a project's dependencies, run tests and run your code.

Dependencies must be specified in the `mix.exs` file.

## Folder structure

A sample folder structure for an Elixir application generated by Mix:
```
my_app
├── config
│   └── config.exs
├── lib
│   ├── my_app
│   │   └── application.ex
│   └── my_app.ex
├── mix.exs
├── README.md
└── test
    ├── my_app_test.exs
    └── test_helper.exs
```
